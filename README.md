### WTF is MVP?


>MVP is a user interface architectural pattern engineered to facilitate automated unit testing and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic:
The model is an interface defining the data to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the user interface.
The presenter acts upon the model and the view. It retrieves data from repositories (the model), and formats it for display in the view.
The view is a passive interface that displays data (the model) and routes user commands (events) to the presenter to act upon that data
